## README

I am going to make a portfolio website for my sister as she is currently studying Make Up and Special FX at Uni. She wants the site to have a blog so I searched around for blog gems to plug into Rails. The best one I found by far was [blogo](https://github.com/greyblake/blogo). 

To test it out I used it to generate a blog and was impressed by how easy it was to use (both to plug into the app and for the user to create blogs). 

I want to keep a consistent 'look' to the final site so in this experiment I also figured out how to over-ride the default layout and styling of the '/blog' page. This can be changed from `app/assets/stylesheets/styles.sass` and `app/views/layouts/blogo/blog.html.erb`.
